JSHint integration for the Eclipse IDE
======================================

[JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/about/) is a popular, community-driven tool to detect
errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.  This project integrates JSHint into
the Eclipse IDE.  It automatically validates \*.js files and adds warning markers for
every problem found by JSHint.

Please see the [project page](http://github.eclipsesource.com/jshint-eclipse/)
